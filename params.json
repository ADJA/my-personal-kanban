No fluff, just basics.\r\n\r\n## How to use it?\r\n\r\nOpen __index.html__ page in your browser and your done.\r\n\r\nThe application is a single file HTML page with Twitter Bootstrap used for styling and jQuery to help some basic document manipulation.\r\n\r\n### Functionality\r\n\r\nThe functionality is simple and pure.\r\n\r\nYou can __change Kanban name__ by clicking top header and edit it inline.\r\n\r\nYou can __choose from a predefined list of column numbers__ for your Kanban.\r\n\r\nYou can __Click on Column headers__ to rename them.\r\n\r\n__Plus sign in the top right corner__ can be used to add new Card to a column.\r\n\r\nCard could be Moved between columns with __arrow buttons__ or removed with a __Cross button__.\r\n\r\n### Menu\r\n\r\nThere should be a Menu in the Top right corner.\r\n\r\nYou can __persist your Kanban to a local storage__ of your browser.

It is impossible to have more than one at the moment, unless you open the __index.html__ in a different browsers.\r\n\r\n## More about technology\r\n\r\n### First a bit of a history\r\n\r\nI started this little project 2 years ago when I decided to familiarise myself with HTML5, Pure JavaScript and CSS.\r\n\r\nI used jQuery with QUnit for JavaScript TDD testing.\r\n\r\nI managed to get it to a workable state and stop developing it.\r\n\r\n### How things are now?\r\n\r\nAt some point I decided that I want to use it for my personal stuff. I like Kanban and I use it as a kind of a more sophisticated TODO list.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't entirely working like I wanted it to so I decided to fix it and style it quickly.\r\n\r\nI slapped Twitter Bootstrap on it with jQuery leaking into non-test code.\r\n\r\nFor testing and Browser automation I use Geb to lunch browser and run all the QUnit test.\r\n\r\nBuild script is driven by Gradle.\r\n\r\n### Want to help?\r\n\r\nIf you want to help me with styling or anything else, please do get in touch.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
