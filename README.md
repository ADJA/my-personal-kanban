## A bit of history

I started this little project 2 years ago when I decided to familiarise myself with HTML5, Pure JavaScript and CSS.

I used jQuery with QUnit for JavaScript TDD testing.

I managed to get it to a workable state and stop developing it.

After first public release not too long ago, I decided to rewrite it in __Angular__.

This application is the result of me doing so, while attempting to learn Angular at the same time :)
